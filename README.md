# Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree - Pacman project

In this project, I implement some simple search algorithms for the game pacman. Four algorithm were considered: Depth-first search, Breadth-first search,
Uniform-cost search and A* search. These algorithms were writen in the search.py file.
